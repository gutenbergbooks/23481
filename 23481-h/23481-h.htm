<h2>THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Somewhere</span> in the back of every
man's mind there dwells a strange
wistful desire to be thought a Perfect
Gentleman. And this is much to his
credit, for the Perfect Gentleman, as
thus wistfully contemplated, is a high
ideal of human behavior, although, in
the narrower but honest admiration of
many, he is also a Perfect Ass. Thus,
indeed, he comes down the centuries&mdash;a
sort of Siamese Twins, each miraculously
visible only to its own admirers;
a worthy personage proceeding at one
end of the connecting cartilage, and a
popinjay prancing at the other. Emerson
was, and described, one twin when
he wrote, 'The gentleman is a man of
truth, lord of his own actions, and expressing
that lordship in his behavior;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
not in any manner dependent or servile,
either on persons, or opinions, or possessions.'
Walter Pater, had Leonardo
painted a Perfect Gentleman's portrait
instead of a Perfect Lady's, might have
described the other: 'The presence that
thus rose so strangely beside the tea-table
is expressive of what in the ways
of a thousand years women had come
to desire. His is the head upon which
"all the ends of the world have come,"
and the eyelids are a little weary. He is
older than the tea things among which
he sits.' Many have admired, but few
have tried to imitate, the Perfect Gentleman
of Emerson's definition; yet few
there are who have not felt the wistful
desire for resemblance. But the other is
more objective: his clothes, his manners,
and his habits are easy to imitate.</p>

<p>Of this Perfect Gentleman in the
eighteenth century I recently discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
fossil remains in the <i>Gentleman's
Pocket Library</i> (Boston and Philadelphia,
1794), from which any literary
savant may restore the original. All in
one volume, the Library is a compilation
for Perfect Gentlemen in the shell,
especially helpful with its chapter on
the 'Principles of Politeness'; and many
an honest but foolish youth went about,
I dare say, with this treasure distending
his pocket, bravely hoping to become
a Perfect Gentleman by sheer diligence
of spare-time study. If by chance
this earnest student met an acquaintance
who had recently become engaged,
he would remember the 'distinguishing
diction that marks the man of fashion,'
and would 'advance with warmth and
cheerfulness, and perhaps squeezing him
by the hand' (oh, horror!) 'would say,
"Believe me, my dear sir, I have scarce
words to express the joy I feel, upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
your happy alliance with such and such
a family, etc."' Of which distinguishing
diction, 'believe <i>me</i>' is now all that
is left.</p>

<p>If, however, he knew that the approaching
victim had been lately bereaved,
he would 'advance slower, and
with a peculiar composure of voice and
countenance, begin his compliments of
condolence with, "I hope, sir, you will
do me the justice to be persuaded, that
I am not insensible to your unhappiness,
that I take part in your distress,
and shall ever be affected when <i>you</i> are
so."'</p>

<p>In lighter mood this still imperfect
Perfect Gentleman would never allow
himself to laugh, knowing, on the word
of his constant pocket-companion, that
laughter is the 'sure sign of a weak
mind, and the manner in which low-bred
men express their silly joy, at silly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
things, and they call it being merry.'
Better <i>always</i>, if necessary, the peculiar
composure of polite sensibility to the
suffering of properly introduced acquaintances.
When he went out, he
would be careful to 'walk well, wear his
hat well, move his head properly, and
his arms gracefully'; and I for one sympathize
with the low-breds if they found
him a merry spectacle; when he went
in, he would remember pertinently that
'a well-bred man is known by his manner
of sitting.' 'Easy in every position,'
say the Principles of Politeness, 'instead
of lolling or lounging as he sits, he leans
with elegance, and by varying his attitudes,
shows that he has been used to
good company.' Good company, one
judges, must have inclined to be rather
acrobatic.</p>

<p>Now, in the seventeen-nineties there
were doubtless purchasers for the <i>Gentleman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Pocket Library</i>: the desire to
become a Perfect Gentleman (like this
one) by home study evidently existed.
But, although I am probably the only
person who has read that instructive
book for a very long time, it remains
to-day the latest complete work which
any young man wishing to become a
Perfect Gentleman can find to study.
Is it possible, I ask myself, that none
but burglars any longer entertain this
ambition? I can hardly believe it. Yet
the fact stands out that, in an age
truly remarkable for its opportunities
for self-improvement, there is nothing
later than 1794 to which I can commend
a crude but determined inquirer. To
my profound astonishment I find that
the Correspondence-School system offers
no course; to my despair I search
the magazines for graphic illustration
of an Obvious Society Leader confiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to an Obvious Scrubwoman: 'Six
months ago <i>my</i> husband was no more a
Perfect Gentleman than <i>yours</i>, but one
day I persuaded him to <i>mark that coupon</i>,
and all our social prominence and
<i>&eacute;clat</i> we owe to that school.'</p>

<p>One may say, indeed, that here is
something which cannot conceivably be
described as a job; but all the more does
it seem, logically, that the correspondence
schools must be daily creating
candidates for what naturally would be
a post-graduate course. One would imagine
that a mere announcement would
be sufficient, and that from all the financial
and industrial centres of the country
students would come flocking back
to college in the next mail.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 16em;"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Be a Perfect Gentleman</span></p>

<p>In the Bank&mdash;at the Board of Directors&mdash;putting
through that New Railroad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in Alaska&mdash;wherever you are and
whatever you are doing to drag down
the Big Money&mdash;wouldn't you feel
more at ease if you <i>knew</i> you were behaving
like a Perfect Gentleman?</p>

<p>We will teach YOU how.</p></div>

<p>Some fifty odd years ago Mr. George
H. Calvert (whom I am pained to find
recorded in the <i>Dictionary of American
Authors</i> as one who 'published a great
number of volumes of verse that was
never mistaken for poetry by any reader')
wrote a small book about gentlemen,
fortunately in prose and not meant
for beginners, in which he cited Bayard,
Sir Philip Sidney, Charles Lamb, Brutus,
St. Paul, and Socrates as notable
examples. Perfect Gentlemen all, as
Emerson would agree, I question if any
of them ever gave a moment's thought
to his manner of sitting; yet any two,
sitting together, would have recognized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
each other as Perfect Gentlemen at
once and thought no more about it.</p>

<p>These are the standard, true to Emerson's
definition; and yet such shining
examples need not discourage the rest
of us. The qualities that made them
gentlemen are not necessarily the qualities
that made them famous. One need
not be as polished as Sidney, but one
must not scratch. One need not have
a mind like Socrates: a gentleman may
be reasonably perfect,&mdash;and surely this
is not asking too much,&mdash;with mind
enough to follow this essay. Brutus
gained nothing as a gentleman by assisting
at the assassination of C&aelig;sar
(who was no more a gentleman, by the
way, in Mr. Calvert's opinion, than
was Mr. Calvert a poet in that of the
<i>Dictionary of Authors</i>).</p>

<p>As for Fame, it is quite sufficient&mdash;and
this only out of gentlemanly consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for the convenience of others&mdash;for
a Perfect Gentleman to have his
name printed in the Telephone Directory.
And in this higher definition I
go so far as to think that the man is
rare who is not sometimes a Perfect
Gentleman, and equally uncommon
who never is anything else. Adam I hail
a Perfect Gentleman when, seeing what
his wife had done, he bit back the bitter
words he might have said, and then&mdash;he
too&mdash;took a bite of the apple: but
oh! how far he fell immediately afterward,
when he stammered his pitiable
explanation that the woman tempted
him and he did eat! Bayard, Sir Philip
Sidney, Charles Lamb, St. Paul, or Socrates
would have insisted, and stuck to
it, that <i>he bit it first</i>.</p>

<p>I have so far left out of consideration&mdash;as
for that matter did the author and
editor of the <i>Pocket Library</i> (not wishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to discourage students)&mdash;a qualification
essential to the Perfect Gentleman
in the eighteenth century. He
must have had&mdash;what no book could
give him&mdash;an ancestor who knew how
to sit. Men there were whose social
status was visibly signified by the abbreviation
'Gent.' appended to their
surnames. But already this was becoming
a vermiform appendix, and the nineteenth
century did away with it. This
handsome abbreviation created an invidious
distinction between citizens which
democracy refused longer to countenance;
and, much as a Lenin would destroy
the value of money in Russia by
printing countless rouble notes without
financial backing, so democracy destroyed
the distinctive value of the word
'gentleman' by applying it indiscriminately
to the entire male population of
the United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentleman continues in various
degrees of perfection. There is no other
name for him, but one hears it rarely;
yet the shining virtue of democratization
is that it has produced a kind of
tacit agreement with Chaucer's Parson
that 'to have pride in the gentrie of
the bodie is right gret folie; for oft-time
the gentrie of the bodie benimeth
the gentrie of the soul; and also we
be all of one fader and one moder.' And
although there are few men nowadays
who would insist that they <i>are</i> gentlemen,
there is probably no man living
in the United States who would admit
that he isn't.</p>

<p>And so I now see that my bright
dream of a Correspondence-School post-graduate
course cannot be realized. No
bank president, no corporation director,
electrical engineer, advertising expert,
architect, or other distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
alumnus would confess himself no gentleman
by <i>marking that coupon</i>. The
suggestion would be an insult, were it
affectionately made by the good old
president of his Alma Mater in a personal
letter. A few decorative cards, to
be hung up in the office, might perhaps
be printed and mailed at graduation.</p>

<h2>AS A MAN DRESSES</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">At</span> some time or other, I dare say, it
is common experience for a man
to feel indignant at the necessity of
dressing himself. He wakes in the morning.
Refreshed with sleep, ready and
eager for his daily tasks and pleasures,
he is just about to leap out of bed when
the thought confronts him that he must
put on his clothes. His leap is postponed
indefinitely, and he gets up with customary
reluctance. One after another,
twelve articles&mdash;eleven, if two are
joined in union one and inseparable&mdash;must
be buttoned, tied, laced, and possibly
safety-pinned to his person: a routine
business, dull, wearisome with repetition.
His face and hands must be
washed, his hair and teeth brushed:
many, indeed, will perform all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
what Keats, thinking of the ocean eternally
washing the land, has called a
'priestlike task of pure ablution'; but
others, faithful to tradition and Saturday
night, will dodge this as wasteful.
Downstairs in summer is his hat; in winter,
his hat, his overcoat, his muffler,
and, if the weather compels, his galoshes
and perhaps his ear-muffs or ear-bobs.
Last thing of all, the Perfect
Gentleman will put on his walking-stick;
somewhere in this routine he will
have shaved and powdered, buckled his
wrist-watch, and adjusted his spats.</p>

<p>When we think of the shortness of
life, and how, even so, we might improve
our minds by study between getting
up and breakfast, dressing, as educators
are beginning to say of the long
summer vacation, seems a sheer 'wastage
of education'; yet the plain truth is
that we wouldn't get up. Better, if we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
can, to <i>think</i> while we dress, pausing to
jot down our worth-while thoughts on
a handy tablet. Once, I remember,&mdash;and
perhaps the pleasant custom continues,&mdash;a
lady might modestly express
her kindly feeling for a gentleman
(and her shy, half-humorous recognition
of the difference between them) by
giving him shaving-paper; why not a
somewhat similar tablet, to record his
dressing-thoughts?</p>

<p>'Clothes,' so wrote Master Thomas
Fuller,&mdash;and likely enough the idea
occurred to him some morning while
getting into his hose and doublet,&mdash;'ought
to be our remembrancers of our
lost innocency.' And so they are; for
Adam must have bounded from bed to
breakfast with an innocency that nowadays
we can only envy.</p>

<p>Yet, in sober earnest, the first useful
thing that ever this naked fellow set his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hand to was the making of his own
apron. The world, as we know and love
it, began&mdash;your pardon, Mr. Kipling,
but I cannot help it&mdash;when</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 27em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cross-legged our Father Adam sat and fastened them one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, leaf by leaf, with loving care he got his apron done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first new suit the world had seen, and mightily pleased with it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the Devil chuckled behind the Tree, 'It's pretty, but will it fit?'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>From that historic moment everything
a man does has been preceded by dressing,
and almost immediately the process
lost its convenient simplicity. Not
since Adam's apron has any complete
garment, or practical suit of clothes,
been devised&mdash;except for sea-bathing&mdash;that
a busy man could slip on in the
morning and off again at night. All our
indignation to the contrary, we prefer
the complicated and difficult: we enjoy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
our buttons; we are withheld only by
our queer sex-pride from wearing garments
that button up in the back&mdash;indeed,
on what we frankly call our 'best
clothes,' we <i>have the buttons</i> though we
<i>dare not button</i> with them. The one costume
that a man could slip on at night
and off again in the morning has never,
if he could help it, been worn in general
society, and is now outmoded by a
pretty little coat and pantaloons of soft
material and becoming color. We come
undressed; but behold! thousands of
years before we were born, it was decided
that we must be dressed as soon
as possible afterward, and clothes were
made for us while it was yet in doubt
whether we would be a little gentleman
or a little lady. And so a man's first
clothes are cunningly fashioned to do
for either; worse still,&mdash;a crying indignity
that, oh, thank Heaven, he cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
remember in maturity,&mdash;he is forcibly
valeted by a woman, very likely
young and attractive, to whom he has
never been formally introduced.</p>

<p>But with this nameless, speechless,
and almost invertebrate thing that he
once was&mdash;this little kicking Maeterlinck
(if I may so call it) between the
known and the unknown worlds&mdash;the
mature self-dresser will hardly concern
himself. Rather, it may be, will he contemplate
the amazing revolution which,
in hardly more than a quarter-century,
has reversed public opinion, and created
a free nation which, no longer regarding
a best-dresser with fine democratic contempt,
now seeks, with fine democratic
unanimity, to be a best-dresser itself.
Or perhaps, smiling, he will recall Dr.
Jaeger, that brave and lonely spirit who
sought to persuade us that no other
garment is so comfortable, so hygienic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
so convenient, and so becoming to all
figures, as the union suit&mdash;and that
it should be worn externally, with certain
modifications to avoid arrest. His
photograph, thus attired, is stamped
on memory: a sensible, bearded gentleman,
inclining to stoutness, comfortably
dressed in eye-glasses and a modified
union suit. And then, almost at the
same moment, the Clothing Industry,
perhaps inspired by the doctor's courage
and informed by his failure, started
the revolution, since crowned by critical
opinion, in a Sunday newspaper,
that 'The American man, considering
him in all the classes that constitute
American society, is to-day the best-dressed,
best-kept man in the world.'</p>

<p>Forty or fifty years ago no newspaper
could plausibly have made that statement,
and, if it had, its office would
probably have been wrecked by a mob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of insulted citizens; but the Clothing
Industry knew us better than Dr. Jaeger,
better even than we knew ourselves.
Its ideal picture of a handsome,
snappy young fellow, madly enjoying
himself in exquisitely fitting, ready-to-wear
clothes, stirred imaginations that
had been cold and unresponsive to the
doctor's photograph. We admired the
doctor for his courage, but we admired
the handsome, snappy young fellow for
his looks; nay, more, we jumped in multitudes
to the conclusion, which has
since been partly borne out, that ready-to-wear
clothes would make us all look
like him. And so, in all the classes that
constitute American society (which I
take to include everybody who wears
a collar), the art of dressing, formerly
restricted to the few, became popular
with the many. Other important and
necessary industries&mdash;the hatters, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
shoemakers, the shirtmakers, the cravatters,
the hosiers, even the makers of
underwear&mdash;hurried out of hiding; and
soon, whoever had eyes to look could
study that handsome, snappy young
fellow in every stage of costume,&mdash;for
the soap-makers also saw their opportunity,&mdash;from
the bath up.</p>

<p>The tailor survived, thanks probably
to the inevitable presence of Doubting
Thomas in any new movement; but he,
too, has at last seen the light. I read
quite recently his announcement that
in 1919 men's clothes would be 'sprightly
without conspicuousness; dashing
without verging on extremes; youthful
in temperament and inspirational.'
Some of us, it appears, remain self-conscious
and a little afraid to snap; and
there the tailor catches us with his
cunningly conceived 'sprightly without
conspicuousness.' Unlike the <i>vers-libre</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
poetess who would fain 'go naked in the
street and walk unclothed into people's
parlors,'&mdash;leaving, one imagines, an
idle but deeply interested gathering on
the sidewalk,&mdash;we are timid about extremes.
We wish to dash&mdash;but within
reasonable limits. Nor, without forcing
the note, would we willingly miss an
opportunity to inspire others, or commit
the affectation of concealing a still
youthful temperament.</p>

<p>A thought for the tablet: <i>As a man
dresses, so he is.</i></p>

<p>Thirty or forty years ago there were
born, and lived in a popular magazine,
two gentlemen-heroes whose perfect
friendship was unmarred by rivalry because,
like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
they were of such different but
equally engaging types of manly beauty.
I forget whether they married sisters,
but they live on in the memory as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ornamental symbols of a vanished past&mdash;a
day when fiction-writers impressed
it, on their readers with every means at
their command, that a hero was well-dressed,
well-washed, and well-groomed.
Such details have become unnecessary,
and grumpy stand-patters no longer
contemptuously mutter, 'Soap! Soap!'
when a hero comes down to breakfast.
Some of our older politicians, to be sure,
still wear a standard costume of Prince
Albert coat, pants (for so one must call
them) that bag at the knee, and an impersonal
kind of black necktie, sleeping,
I dare say, in what used jocularly to
be called a 'nightie'; but our younger
leaders go appropriately clad, to the
eye, in exquisitely fitting, ready-to-wear
clothes. So, too, does the Correspondence-School
graduate, rising like an
escaped balloon from his once precarious
place among the untrained workers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to the comfortable security of general
manager. Here and there, an echo of
the past, persists the pretence that men
are superior to any but practical considerations
in respect to clothing; but
if this were so, I need hardly point out
that more would dress like Dr. Jaeger,
and few waste precious moments fussing
over the selection of prettily colored
ribbons to wear round their necks.</p>

<p>Fortunately we need no valets, and
a democracy of best-dressers is neither
more nor less democratic than one of
shirt-sleeves: the important thing in
both cases is that the great majority of
citizens all look alike. The alarm-clock
awakens us, less politely than a James
or Joseph, but we need never suspect
it of uncomplimentary mental reservations,
and neither its appetite nor its
morals cause us uneasiness. Fellow-citizens
of Greek extraction maintain parlors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
where we may sit, like so many statues
on the Parthenon, while they polish
our shoes. In all large cities are quiet
retreats where it is quite conventional,
and even <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i>, for the most Perfect
Gentleman to wait in what still remains
to him, while an obliging fellow creature
swiftly presses his trousers; or, lacking
this convenient retreat, there are shrewd
inventions that crease while we sleep.
Hangers, simulating our own breadth
of shoulders, wear our coats and preserve
their shape. Wooden feet, simulating
our own honest trotters, wear
our shoes and keep them from wrinkling.
No valet could do more. And as
for laying out our clothes, has not the
kind Clothing Industry provided handy
manuals of instruction? With their assistance
any man can lay out the garments
proper to any function, be it a
morning dig in the garden, a noon wedding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
at the White House, or (if you can
conceive it) a midnight supper with
Mrs. Carrie Nation.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;sometimes, that indignation
we feel at having to dress ourselves
in the morning, we feel again at having
to undress ourselves at night. Then indeed
are our clothes a remembrancer of
our lost innocency. We think only of
Adam going to bed. We forget that,
properly speaking, poor innocent Adam
had no bed to go to. And we forget also
that in all the joys of Eden was none
more innocent than ours when we have
just put on a new suit.</p>

<h2>IN THE CHAIR</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">About</span> once in so often a man
must go to the barber for what,
with contemptuous brevity, is called a
haircut. He must sit in a big chair,
a voluminous bib (prettily decorated
with polka dots) tucked in round his
neck, and let another human being cut
his hair for him. His head, with all its
internal mystery and wealth of thought,
becomes for the time being a mere poll,
worth two dollars a year to the tax-assessor:
an irregularly shaped object,
between a summer squash and a cantaloupe,
with too much hair on it, as
very likely several friends have advised
him. His identity vanishes.</p>

<p>As a rule, the less he now says or
thinks about his head, the better: he has
given it to the barber, and the barber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
will do as he pleases with it. It is only
when the man is little and is brought in
by his mother, that the job will be done
according to instructions; and this is
because the man's mother is in a position
to see the back of his head. Also
because the weakest woman under such
circumstances has strong convictions.
When the man is older the barber will
sometimes allow him to see the haircut
cleverly reflected in two mirrors;
but not one man in a thousand&mdash;nay,
in ten thousand&mdash;would dare express
himself as dissatisfied. After all, what
does he know of haircuts, he who is no
barber? Women feel differently; and I
know of one man who, returning home
with a new haircut, was compelled to
turn round again and take what his
wife called his 'poor' head to another
barber by whom the haircut was more
happily finished. But that was exceptional.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
And it happened to that man
but once.</p>

<p>The very word 'haircut' is objectionable.
It snips like the scissors. Yet
it describes the operation more honestly
than the substitute 'trim,' a euphemism
that indicates a jaunty habit of
dropping in frequently at the barber's
and so keeping the hair perpetually at
just the length that is most becoming.
For most men, although the knowledge
must be gathered by keen, patient observation
and never by honest confession,
there is a period, lasting about a
week, when the length of their hair is
admirable. But it comes between haircuts.
The haircut itself is never satisfactory.
If his hair was too long before
(and on this point he has the evidence
of unprejudiced witnesses), it is
too short now. It must grow steadily&mdash;count
on it for that!&mdash;until for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
brief period it is 'just right,' &aelig;sthetically
suited to the contour of his face
and the cut of his features, and beginning
already imperceptibly to grow too
long again.</p>

<p>Soon this growth becomes visible,
and the man begins to worry. 'I must
go to the barber,' he says in a harassed
way. 'I must get a haircut.' But the
days pass. It is always to-morrow, and
to-morrow, and to-morrow. When he
goes, he goes suddenly.</p>

<p>There is something within us, probably
our immortal soul, that postpones
a haircut; and yet in the end our immortal
souls have little to do with the
actual process. It is impossible to conceive
of one immortal soul cutting another
immortal soul's hair. My own
soul, I am sure, has never entered a
barber's shop. It stops and waits for
me at the portal. Probably it converses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on subjects remote from our bodily consciousness,
with the immortal souls of
barbers, patiently waiting until the
barbers finish their morning's work and
come out to lunch.</p>

<p>Even during the haircut our hair is
still growing, never stopping, never at
rest, never in a hurry: it grows while we
sleep, as was proved by Rip Van Winkle.
And yet perhaps sometimes it is in a
hurry; perhaps that is why it falls out.
In rare cases the contagion of speed
spreads; the last hair hurries after all
the others; the man is emancipated
from dependence on barbers. I know
a barber who is in this independent
condition himself (for the barber can
no more cut his own hair than the rest
of us) and yet sells his customers a preparation
warranted to keep them from
attaining it: a seeming anomaly which
can be explained only on the ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that business is business. To escape
the haircut one must be quite without
hair that one cannot see and reach; and
herein possibly is the reason for a fashion
which has often perplexed students
of the Norman Conquest. The Norman
soldiery wore no hair on the backs of
their heads; and each brave fellow could
sit down in front of his polished shield
and cut his own hair without much
trouble. But the scheme had a weakness;
the back of the head had to be
shaved; and the fashion doubtless went
out because, after all, nothing was
gained by it. One simply turned over
on one's face in the barber's chair instead
of sitting up straight.</p>

<p>Fortunately we begin having a haircut
when we are too young to think,
and when also the process is sugar-coated
by the knowledge that we are
losing our curls. Then habit accustoms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
us to it. Yet it is significant that men
of refinement seek the barber in secluded
places, basements of hotels for
choice, where they can be seen only by
barbers and by other refined men having
or about to have haircuts; and that
men of less refinement submit to the
operation where every passer-by can
stare in and see them, bibs round their
necks and their shorn locks lying in
pathetic little heaps on the floor. There
is a barber's shop of this kind in Boston
where one of the barbers, having no
head to play with, plays on a cornet,
doubtless to the further distress of his
immortal soul peeping in through the
window. But this is unusual even in
the city that is known far and wide as
the home of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.</p>

<p>I remember a barber&mdash;he was the
only one available in a small town&mdash;who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
cut my left ear. The deed distressed
him, and he told me a story. It
was a pretty little cut, he said,&mdash;filling
it with alum,&mdash;and reminded him
of another gentleman whose left ear
he had nipped in identically the same
place. He had done his best with alum
and apology, as he was now doing. Two
months later the gentleman came in
again. 'And by golly!' said the barber,
with a kind of wonder at his own
cleverness, 'if I didn't nip him again
in just the same place!'</p>

<p>A man can shave himself. The Armless
Wonder does it in the Dime Museum.
Byron did it, and composed
poetry during the operation; although,
as I have recently seen scientifically explained,
the facility of composition was
not due to the act of shaving but to
the normal activity of the human mind
at that time in the morning. Here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
therefore, a man can refuse the offices
of the barber. If he wishes to make one
of a half-dozen apparently inanimate
figures, their faces covered with soap,
and their noses used as convenient
handles to turn first one cheek and
then the other&mdash;that is his own lookout.
But human ingenuity has yet to
invent a 'safety barber's shears.' It
has tried. A near genius once invented
an apparatus&mdash;a kind of helmet with
multitudinous little scissors inside it&mdash;which
he hopefully believed would
solve the problem; but what became of
him and his invention I have not heard.
Perhaps he tried it himself and slunk,
defeated, into a deeper obscurity. Perhaps
he committed suicide; for one can
easily imagine that a man who thought
he had found a way to cut his own hair
and then found that he hadn't, would
be thrown into a suicidal depression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
There is the possibility that he succeeded
in cutting his own hair, and was
immediately 'put away,' by his sensitive
family where nobody could see him
but the hardened attendants. The important
fact is that the invention never
got on the market. Until some other
investigator succeeds to more practical
purpose, the rest of us must go periodically
to the barber. We must put on
the bib&mdash;</p>

<p>Here, however, there is at least an
opportunity of selection. There are
bibs with arms, and bibs without arms.
And there is a certain amount of satisfaction
in being able to see our own
hands, carefully holding the newspaper
or periodical wherewith we pretend that
we are still intelligent human beings.
And here again are distinctions. The
patrons of my own favored barber's
shop have arms to their bibs and pretend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to be deeply interested in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>. The patrons of the
barber's shop where I lost part of my
ear&mdash;I cannot see the place, but those
whom I take into my confidence tell
me that it has long since grown again&mdash;had
no sleeves to their bibs, but
nevertheless managed awkwardly to
hold the <i>Police Gazette</i>. And this opportunity
to hold the <i>Police Gazette</i> without
attracting attention becomes a
pleasant feature of this type of barber's
shop: I, for example, found it easier&mdash;until
my ear was cut&mdash;to forget
my position in the examination of this
journal than in the examination of the
<i>Illustrated London News</i>. The pictures,
strictly speaking, are not so good, either
artistically or morally, but there is a
tang about them, an I-do-not-know-what.
And it is always wisest to focus
attention on some such extraneous interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Otherwise you may get to
looking in the mirror.</p>

<p>Do not do that.</p>

<p>For one thing, there is the impulse
to cry out, 'Stop! Stop! Don't cut it
all off!</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Oh, barber, spare that hair!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leave some upon my brow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For months it's sheltered me!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I'll protect it now!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>'Oh, please! P-l-e-a-s-e!&mdash;'</p>

<p>These exclamations annoy a barber,
rouse a demon of fury in him. He
reaches for a machine called 'clippers.'
Tell him how to cut hair, will you! A
little more and he'll shave your head&mdash;and
not only half-way either, like the
Norman soldiery at the time of the Conquest!
Even if you are able to restrain
this impulse, clenching your bib in your
hands and perhaps dropping or tearing
the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, the mirror<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
gives you strange, morbid reflections.
You recognize your face, but your head
seems somehow separate, balanced on
a kind of polka-dotted mountain with
two hands holding the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>. You are afraid momentarily
that the barber will lift it off and go
away with it.</p>

<p>Then is the time to read furiously the
weekly contribution of G. K. Chesterton.
But your mind reverts to a story
you have been reading about how
the Tulululu islanders, a savage but
ingenious people, preserve the heads of
their enemies so that the faces are much
smaller but otherwise quite recognizable.
You find yourself looking keenly
at the barber to discover any possible
trace of Tulululu ancestry.</p>

<p>And what is he going to get now?
A <i>kris</i>? No, a paint-brush. Is he going
to paint you? And if so&mdash;what color?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The question of color becomes strangely
important, as if it made any real difference.
Green? Red? Purple? Blue?
No, he uses the brush dry, tickling your
forehead, tickling your ears, tickling
your nose, tickling you under the chin
and down the back of your neck. After
the serious business of the haircut, a
barber must have some relaxation.</p>

<p>There is one point on which you are
independent: you will not have the
bay rum; you are a teetotaller. You
say so in a weak voice which nevertheless
has some adamantine quality that
impresses him. He humors you; or
perhaps your preference appeals to his
sense of business economy.</p>

<p>He takes off your bib.</p>

<p>From a row of chairs a man leaps to
his feet, anxious to give <i>his</i> head to the
barber. A boy hastily sweeps up the
hair that was yours&mdash;already as remote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
from you as if it had belonged to
the man who is always waiting, and
whose name is Next. Oh, it is horrible&mdash;horrible&mdash;horrible!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>OH, SHINING SHOES!</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> a democracy it is fitting that a
man should sit on a throne to have
his shoes polished, or, to use a brighter,
gayer word, shined. We are all kings,
and this happy conceit of popular government
is nicely symbolized by being,
for these shining moments, so many
kings together, each on his similar
throne and with a slave at his feet.
The democratic idea suffers a little from
the difficulty of realizing that the slave
is also a king, yet gains a little from the
fair custom of the livelier monarchs of
turning from left foot to right and from
right to left, so that, within human
limits, neither shoe shall be undemocratically
shined first.</p>

<p>Nor is it uncommon for the kings on
the thrones to be symbolically and inexpensively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
served by yet other sovereign
servants. Newspapers in hand,
they receive the reports of their lord
high chancellors, digest the social gossip
of their realm, review its crimes, politics,
discoveries, and inventions, and are entertained
by their jesters, who, I have
it on the authority of a current advertisement,
all democratically smoke the
same kind of tobacco. 'You know 'em
all, the great fun-makers of the daily
press, agile-brained and nimble-witted,
creators of world-famed characters who
put laughter into life. Such live, virile
humans as they <i>must</i> have a live, virile
pipe-smoke.' There are, to be sure, some
who find in this agile-brained and nimble-witted
mirth an element of profound
melancholy; it seems often a debased
coin of humor, which rings false on the
counter of intelligence; yet even at its
worst it is far better than many of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
waggeries that once stirred laughter in
medi&aelig;val monarchs. The thought renders
them bearable, these live, virile
humans, who only a few centuries ago
would have been too handicapped by
their refinement to compete successfully
with contemporary humorists.</p>

<p>But there are a good many of us, possessors
of patience, self-control, and a
sponge in a bottle, who rarely enjoy this
royal prerogative. We shine our own
shoes. Alone, and, if one may argue from
the particular to the general, simply
dressed in the intermediate costume,
more or less becoming, that is between
getting up and going out, we wear a shoe
on our left hand, and with the other
manipulate the helpful sponge. Sometimes,
too anxious, it polka-dots our
white garments, sometimes the floor; it
is safe only in the bottle, and the wisest
shiner will perhaps approach the job as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
an Adamite, bestriding, like a colossus,
a wide-spread newspaper, and taking a
bath afterward. Or it may be that instead
of the bottle we have a little tin
box, wedded to its cover,&mdash;how often
have we not exclaimed between clenched
teeth, 'What man hath joined together
man can pull asunder!'&mdash;and containing
a kind of black mud, which we apply
with an unfortunate rag or with a brush
appropriately called the 'dauber.' Having
daubed, we polish, breathing our
precious breath on the luminous surface
for even greater luminosity. The time
is passing when we performed this task
of pure lustration, as Keats might have
called it, in the cellar or the back hall,
more fully, but not completely, dressed,
coatless, our waistcoats rakishly unbuttoned
or vulgarly upstairs, our innocent
trousers hanging on their gallowses,
our shoes on our feet, and our physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
activity not altogether unlike that demanded
by a home-exerciser to reduce
the abdomen. Men of girth have been
advised to saw wood; I wonder that they
never have been advised to shine their
own shoes&mdash;twenty-five times in the
morning and twenty-five times just before
going to bed.</p>

<p>My own observation, although not
continuous enough to have scientific
value, leads me to think that stout men
are the more inveterate patrons of the
shoe-blacking parlor,&mdash;C&aelig;sar should
have run one,&mdash;and that the present
popularity of the sponge in a bottle may
derive from superfluous girth. Invented
as a dainty toilet accessory for women,
and at first regarded by men as effeminate,
it is easy to see how insidiously the
sponge in a bottle would have attracted
a stout husband accustomed to shine
his own shoes in the earlier contortionist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
manner. By degrees, first one stout
husband and then another, men took to
the bottle; the curse of effeminacy was
lifted; the habit grew on men of all sizes.
It was not a perfect method,&mdash;it blacked
too many other things besides shoes,
and provided an undesirable plaything
for baby,&mdash;but it was a step forward.
There was a refinement, a <i>je ne sais
quoi</i>, an 'easier way,' about this sponge
in a bottle; and, perhaps more than all,
a delusive promise that the stuff would
dry shiny without friction, which appealed
to the imagination.</p>

<p>Then began to disappear a household
familiar&mdash;that upholstered, deceptive,
utilitarian hassock kind of thing which,
when opened, revealed an iron foot-rest,
a box of blacking,&mdash;I will not <i>say</i>
how some moistened that blacking, but
you and I, gentle reader, brought water
in a crystal glass from the kitchen,&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
an ingenious tool which combined
the offices of dauber and shiner, so that
one never knew how to put it away right
side up. This tool still exists, an honest,
good-sized brush carrying a round baby
brush pickaback; and I dare say an occasional
old-fashioned gentleman shines
his shoes with it; but in the broader
sense of that pernicious and descriptive
phrase it is no longer used 'by the best
people.' Of late, I am told by shopkeepers,
the tin box with the pervicacious
cover is becoming popular; but I remain
true to my sponge in a bottle: for, unlike
the leopard, I am able to change my
spots.</p>

<p>Looking along the ages from the vantage
of a throne in the shoe-blacking
parlor, it is a matter of pleased wonder
to observe what the mind has found to
do with the feet; nor is the late invention
of shoe-polish (hardly earlier than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Declaration of Independence) the least
surprising item. For the greater part of
his journey man has gone about his businesses
in unshined footwear, beginning,
it would appear, with a pair of foot-bags,
or foot-purses, each containing a valuable
foot, and tied round the ankle.
Thus we see him, far down the vista of
time, a tiny figure stopping on his way
to tie up his shoe-strings. Captivated
with form and color, he exhausted his
invention in shapes and materials before
ever he thought of polish: he cut
his toes square; he cut his toes so long
and pointed that he must needs tie them
to his knee to keep from falling over
them; he wore soles without uppers,&mdash;alas!
poor devil, how often in all ages
has he approximated wearing uppers
without soles!&mdash;and he went in for top-boots
splendidly belegged and coquettishly
beautified with what, had he been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a lady, he might have described as an
insertion of lace. At last came the boot-blacking
parlor, late nineteenth century,
commercial, practical, convenient, and
an important factor in civic aesthetics.
Not that the parlor is beautiful in itself.
It is a cave without architectural pretensions,
but it accomplishes unwittingly
an important mission: it removes
from public view the man who is having
his shoes shined.</p>

<p>You know him, as the advertisement
says of the live, virile humans who <i>must</i>
have the live, virile pipe-smoke; but happily
you know him nowadays chiefly
by effort of memory. Yet only a little
while ago kindly, well-intentioned men
thought nothing of having their shoes
shined in the full glare of the sun. The
man having his shoes shined was a
common spectacle. He sat or stood
where anybody might see him, almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
as immobile as a cigar-store Indian and
much less decorative, with a peripatetic
shoeblack busy at his feet. His standing
attitude was a little like Washington
crossing the Delaware; and when he sat
down, he was not wholly unlike the picture
of Jupiter in Mr. Bulfinch's well-known
<i>Age of Fable</i>. He had his shoes
shined on the sidewalk, congesting
traffic; he had them shined in the park,
with the birds singing; wherever he had
them shined, he was as lacking in self-consciousness
as a baby sucking its
thumb. Peripatetic shoeblacks pursued
pedestrians, and no sensitive gentleman
was safe from them merely because he
had carefully and well shined his own
shoes before he came out. But how
rarely nowadays do we see this peripatetic
shoeblack! Soon he will be as
extinct as the buffalo, and the shoe-blacking
parlor is his Buffalo Bill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In the shoe-blacking parlor we are all
tarred with the same brush, all daubed
with the same dauber; we have nothing,
as the rather enigmatical phrase goes,
<i>on</i> one another. Indeed, we hardly look
at one another, and are as remote as
strangers sitting side by side in a theatre.
Individually, in a steady, subconscious
way, I think we are all wondering how
we are going to get down when the time
comes. One will hop, like a great sparrow;
another will turn round and descend
backward; another will come down with
an absent-minded little wave of the
foot, as if he were quite used to having
his shoes shined and already thinking
of more serious business; another&mdash;but
this is sheer nervousness and lack of
<i>savoir-faire</i>&mdash;will step off desperately,
as if into an abyss, and come down with
a thump. Sometimes, but rarely, a man
will fall off. It is a throne&mdash;and perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
this is true of all thrones&mdash;from
which no altogether self-satisfactory
descent is possible; and we all know it,
sitting behind our newspapers, or staring
down on decadent Greece shining
at our feet, or examining with curious,
furtive glances those calendars the feminine
beauty of which seems peculiar to
shoe-blacking parlors, and has sometimes
led us to wonder whether the late
Mr. Comstock ever had his shoes shined.</p>

<p>And now, behold! the slave-king at
my feet has found a long, narrow strip
of linen, not, I fear, antiseptic, but
otherwise suggestive of a preparedness
course in first aid to the injured. He
breathes on my shoes (O unhygienic
shoeblack!), dulling them to make them
brighter with his strip of linen. It is
my notice to abdicate; he turns down
the bottoms of my trousers. I do not
know how I get down from the throne.</p>

<h2>ON MAKING CALLS</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I know</span> a boy who dislikes to make
calls. Making a call, he says, is
'just sitting on a chair.'</p>

<p>I have had the same feeling, although
I had never defined it so nicely. One
'just sits on a chair'&mdash;precariously,
yet with an odd sense of unhappy security,
of having grown to and become
part of that chair, as if one dreaded to
fall off, yet strongly suspected that any
real effort to get up and go away would
bring the chair up and away with him.
He is, so to speak, like a barnacle on a
rock in an ocean of conversation. He
may exhibit unbarnacle-like activity,
cross and uncross his legs, fold and unfold
his arms, twiddle his useful fingers,
incline his tired head this way and that
to relieve the strain on his neck, assume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
(like an actor) expressions of interest,
amusement, surprise, pleasure, or what
not. He may even speak or laugh. But
he remains sitting on his chair. He is
more and more certain that he cannot
get up.</p>

<p>He is unlike the bottoms of his own
trousers. Calmly, quietly, and by imperceptible
degrees <i>they</i> get up. Higher
and higher they ascend kneeward; they
have an ambition to achieve the waist.
Every little while he must unostentatiously,
and with an easy, careless, indifferent,
well-bred, and even <i>blas&eacute;</i> gesture,
manage to pull them down.</p>

<p>I am referring, you understand, to
the mature, married gentleman. Between
boyhood and maturity there is a
period (without which there would be
fewer marriages, and perhaps none at
all) when a call is a personal adventure,
and it often happens that the recipient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of the call, rather than the caller himself,
fears that somehow or other he
and his chair have grown together.
But my boy friend, as I think you will
agree when you consider his situation,
does not, strictly speaking, call: he is
taken to call. And just so is it with
the average mature, married gentleman;
the chief difference&mdash;and even this
does not invariably hold good&mdash;is that
he dresses himself. He has become part
and parcel (particularly parcel) of a
wise and necessary division of life in
which the social end is taken over by a
feminine partner. She is the expert.
She knows when and where to call,
what to say, and when to go home.
Married, a gentleman has no further
responsibilities in this business&mdash;except
to come cheerfully and sit on his
chair without wriggling. Sometimes,
indeed, he takes a pleasure in it, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that is only when he has momentarily
forgotten that he is making a call. These
are his rewarding moments; and then,
the first thing he knows, somebody is
'making signs' that it is time to go
home!</p>

<p>The wise man, noticing these 'signs,'
comes home. He stands not upon the
order of his coming, but comes at once.</p>

<p>A call, says Herbert Spencer, in his
<i>Principles of Sociology</i>, is 'evidently a
remote sequence of that system under
which a subordinate ruler had from
time to time to show loyalty to a chief
ruler by presenting himself to do homage.'
The idea is plausible: was it not
for this very reason that Cleopatra galleyed
down the Cydnus to call on Antony,&mdash;a
call that would probably have
had a different effect on history if the
lady had brought a husband,&mdash;and
Sheba cameled across the desert to call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on Solomon? The creditor character
of the visitation survives in the common
expression 'paying a call.' In both
these cases, however, the calls took on
a lighter and brighter aspect, a more
reciprocally admiring and well-affected
intimacy, than was strictly necessary
to an act of political homage. One is,
after all, human; and the absence of
marital partners, whose presence is always
a little subduing, must be taken
into consideration. 'But Solomon,' you
say, 'Solomon?' Sir and madam, I
rise to your question. In such a situation
a man with seven hundred wives
is as good as a bachelor; and I think
the fact that Solomon had seven hundred
wives proves it.</p>

<p>Later the Feudal System provided
natural scope for innumerable calls of
this nature; visits, as we should now
term them, because it was customary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
for the callers to bring their nighties&mdash;or
would have been if the callers had
had any. The Dark Ages, curiously
enough, lacked this garment of the dark.
But it was only after the Feudal Period
that the call, as we now know and practise
it, became a social custom; and even
to this day feudalism, in an attenuated
form, rules society, and the call is often
enough an act of homage to the superior
social chief. One might argue (except
for the fact that Sheba <i>gave</i> as well
as exhibited her treasurer to Solomon)
that Mrs. Jones is but following historic
precedent when she brings and exhibits
Mr. Jones to Mrs. Smith. Or, again, it
might be pointed out that both Cleopatra
and Sheba <i>brought their slaves</i>.
There is, apparently, more than one
sequence (as Mr. Spencer would say),
but there is also a wide divergence from
original type. Only partly and occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
an act of homage, the call has
become, broadly speaking, a recognition
of exact social equality, as if the
round, dignified American cheese in
Grocer Brown's ice-box should receive
and return a call from the round, dignified
American cheese in Grocer Green's
ice-box.</p>

<p>And it has become divisible into as
many varieties as Mr. Heinz's pickles.&mdash;The
<i>call friendly</i> ('Let us go and call
on the Smiths: I'd like to see them');
the <i>call compulsory</i> ('We really <i>must</i>
make that call on the Smiths'); the
<i>call curious</i> ('I wonder if it's so, what
I heard yesterday about the Smiths');
the <i>call convenient</i> ('As we haven't
anything better to do this evening, we
might call on the Smiths'); the <i>call
proud</i> ('Suppose we get out the new
motor, and run round to the Smiths');
and so forth, and so forth. But, however<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
we look at it, the call is dependent
upon feminine initiative. Our mature
married gentleman, unless he has had
already a call to the ministry, has no
call, socially speaking, to make calls. It
is his wife's business. As British soldiers
have grimly sung on their way to battle,
'He's there because he's there, because
he's there, because he's there.' But it
is his plain duty to <i>sit on his chair</i>. I do
not hold it legitimate in him to 'sneak
off' with Mr. Smith&mdash;and smoke.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, once he is
there, little else is expected of him&mdash;and
nothing that a man should not be
willing to do for his wife. A smile, an
attentive manner, the general effect
of having combed his hair and washed
behind his ears, a word now and then
to show that he is awake (I am assuming
that he controls the tendency
to wriggle)&mdash;and no more is needed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
He is a lay figure, but not necessarily a
lay figure of speech.</p>

<p>Unless a man who is taken to call is
of an abnormally lively conversational
habit, quick to think of something that
may pass for a contribution to current
thought, and even quicker to get it
out, he had best accept his position as
merely decorative, and try to be as
decorative as possible. He should be so
quick that the first words of his sentence
have leaped into life before he
is himself aware of what is to come
hurrying after them; he may be so slow
that the only sentence he has is still
painfully climbing to the surface long
after the proper time for its appearance
has passed and been forgotten. Swallow
it, my dear sir, swallow it. Silence, accompanied
by a wise, appreciative glance
of the eye, is better; for a man who has
mastered the art of the wise look does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
his wife credit, and is taken home from
a call with his faculties unimpaired and
his self-respect undiminished: he is the
same man as when he was taken out.
But not so the man who starts, hesitates,
and stops, as if he actually said,
'Hold-on-there-I-'ve-got-a-fine-idea&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;on
second thought&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;that
is&mdash;I guess&mdash;er&mdash;it isn't&mdash;worth
hearing.'</p>

<p>Such a man, I say, adds little to the
pleasure of himself or the company; he
attracts attention only to disappoint it:
and others are kind as well as sensible
to ignore him. He should have kept on
rapidly and developed his fine idea to
the bitter end. Nor is it wise to attempt
to shine, to dazzle, to surprise
with a clever epigram, thoughtfully
composed and tested by imaginary
utterance before an imaginary charmed
circle while dressing; for nothing so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
diminishes confidence in an epigram as
successive failures to get it into circulation.
In calling, one must jump
on the train of thought as it speeds by
a way station; and there is no happy
mean between jumping on a passing
train and standing still on the platform&mdash;except,
as I have suggested, a pleasant
wave of the hand as the train passes.</p>

<p>'There are not many situations,'
said Dr. Johnson, 'more incessantly
uneasy than that in which the man is
placed who is watching an opportunity
to speak, without courage to take it
when offered, and who, though he resolves
to give a specimen of his abilities,
always finds some reason or other
for delaying to the next minute.'</p>

<p>I know that resolve; and yet how
often have I, too, failed at the crucial
moment to give the hoped-for specimen
of my abilities! 'Not yet,' I have said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to myself, 'not yet. The time is not
ripe.' And so I have waited, incessantly
uneasy,&mdash;as Dr. Johnson well puts it,&mdash;but
always finding some reason or
other to postpone the fireworks. I was
beset by a kind of gross selfishness&mdash;an
unwillingness to give <i>anybody</i> a specimen
of my abilities. Let them chatter!
Little do they guess&mdash;and never will
they know&mdash;the abilities sitting on
this chair! Give <i>them</i> a specimen! Yet
I must confess also that my specimen
seemed somehow isolated and apart
from my environment. It was all right
in itself, but it needed a setting; it
was like a button without a coat, like
an eye without a face, like a kiss without
a companion.</p>

<h2>THE LIER IN BED</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">If</span> I had to get on with but one article
of furniture, I think I would
choose a bed. One could if necessary
sit, eat, read, and write in the bed. In
past time it has been a social centre: the
hostess received in it, the guests sat
on benches, and the most distinguished
visitor sat on the foot of the bed. It
combines the uses of all the other articles
in the '$198 de luxe special 4-room
outfit' that I have seen advertised for
the benefit of any newly married couple
with twenty dollars of their own for the
first payment. Very few houses, if any,
nowadays are without furniture that
nobody uses, chairs that nobody ever
sits on, books that nobody ever reads,
ornaments that nobody ever wants, pictures
that nobody ever looks at; an accumulation
of unessential objects that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
does credit chiefly to the activity of
manufacturers and merchants catering
to our modern lust for unnecessary expenditure.
Not so many centuries ago
one or two books made quite a respectable
library; dining-room tables were
real banqueting boards laid on trestles
and taken away after the banquet; one
bench might well serve several Perfect
Gentlemen to sit upon; and a chair of
his own was the baron's privilege. Today
the $198 de luxe special 4-room
outfit would feel naked and ashamed
without its '1 Pedestal' and '1 Piece of
Statuary.' Yet what on earth does a
happy couple, bravely starting life with
twenty dollars, want of a pedestal and a
piece of statuary? And I notice also
that the outfit&mdash;'a complete home,'
says the description&mdash;makes no provision
for a kitchen; but perhaps they are
no longer de luxe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible, at this time, to recover
with complete certainty the antiquity
of the bed. We may presume
that the Neanderthal man had a wife
(as wives were then understood) and
maintained a kind of housekeeping that
may have gone no further than pawing
some leaves together to sleep on; but
this probably was a late development.
Earlier we may imagine the wind blowing
the autumn leaves together and a
Neanderthal man lying down by chance
on the pile. He found it pleasant, and,
for a few thousand years, went out of
his way to find piles of leaves to lie
down on, until one day he hit upon the
bright idea of piling the leaves together
himself. Then for the first time a man
had a bed. His sleep was localized; his
pile of leaves, brought together by his
own sedulous hands, became property.
Monogamy was encouraged, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
idea of home came into being. Personally
I have no doubt whatever that the
man who made the first bed was so
charmed with it that the practice of lying
in bed in the morning began immediately;
and it is probably a conservative
statement that the later Pliocene
era saw the custom well developed.</p>

<p>One wonders what the Neanderthal
man would have thought of a de luxe
4-room outfit, or complete home, for
$198.</p>

<p>Even to-day, however, there are
many fortunate persons who are never
awakened by an alarm-clock&mdash;that
watchman's rattle, as it were, of Policeman
Day. The invention is comparatively
recent. Without trying to uncover
the identity of the inventor, and
thus adding one more to the Who's
Who of Pernicious Persons, we may
assume that it belongs naturally to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
age of small and cheap clocks which
dawned only in the nineteenth century.
Some desire for it existed earlier. The
learned Mrs. Carter, said Dr. Johnson,
'at a time when she was eager in study,
did not awake as early as she wished,
and she therefore had a contrivance
that, at a certain hour, her chamber
light should burn a string to which a
heavy weight was suspended, which
then fell with a sudden strong noise;
this roused her from her sleep, and then
she had no difficulty in getting up.'</p>

<p>This device, we judge, was peculiar
to Mrs. Carter, than whom a less eager
student would have congratulated herself
that the sudden strong noise was
over, and gone sweetly to sleep again.
The venerable Bishop Ken, who believed
that a man 'should take no more
sleep than he can take at once,' had no
need of it. He got up, we are told, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
one or two o'clock in the morning 'and
sometimes earlier,' and played the lute
before putting on his clothes.</p>

<p>To me the interesting thing about
these historic figures is that they got up
with such elastic promptness, the one
to study and the other to play the lute.
The Bishop seems a shade the more
eager; but there are details that Mrs.
Carter would naturally have refrained
from mentioning to Dr. Johnson, even
at the brimming moment when he had
just accepted her contribution to the
<i>Rambler</i>. For most of us&mdash;or alarm-clocks
would not be made to ring continuously
until the harassed bed-warmer
gets up and stops the racket&mdash;this
getting out of bed is no such easy matter;
and perhaps it will be the same
when Gabriel's trumpet is the alarm-clock.
We are more like Boswell, honest
sleeper, and have 'thought of a pulley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to raise me gradually'; and then
have thought again and realized that
even a pulley 'would give me pain, as
it would counteract my internal disposition.'
Let the world go hang; our
internal disposition is to stay in bed:
we cling tenaciously to non-existence&mdash;or
rather, to that third state of consciousness
when we are in the world
but not of it.</p>

<p>There are those, no doubt, who will
say that they have something better to
do than waste their time wondering
why they like to stay in bed, which
they don't. They are persons who
have never been bored by the monotony
of dressing or have tried to vary
it, sometimes beginning at one end,
sometimes at the other, but always defeated
by the hard fact that a man cannot
button his collar until he has put
on his shirt. If they condescend so far,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they will say, with some truth, that it
is a question of weather, and any fool
knows that it is not pleasant to get
out of a warm bed into a cold bedroom.
The matter has been considered from
that angle. 'I have been warm all
night,' wrote Leigh Hunt, 'and find
myself in a state perfectly suited to a
warm-blooded animal. To get out of
this state into the cold, besides the inharmonious
and uncritical abruptness
of the transition, is so unnatural to
such a creature that the poets, refining
upon the tortures of the damned, make
one of their greatest agonies consist in
being suddenly transported from heat
to cold&mdash;from fire to ice. They are
"haled" out of their "beds," says Milton,
by "harpy-footed furies"&mdash;fellows
who come to call them.'</p>

<p>But no man, say I, or woman either,
ever lay in bed and devised logical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
reasons for staying there&mdash;unless for
the purposes of an essay, in which case
the recumbent essayist, snuggle as he
may, is mentally up and dressed. He is
really awake. He has tied his necktie.
He is a busy bee&mdash;and I can no more
imagine a busy bee lying in bed than I
can imagine lying in bed with one. He
is no longer in the nice balance between
sense and oblivion that is too serenely
and irresponsibly comfortable to be consciously
analyzed; and in which, so long
as he can stay there without getting
wider awake, nothing else matters.</p>

<p>Lying in bed being a half-way house
between sleeping and waking, and the
mind then equally indifferent to logic
and exact realism, the lier in bed can
and does create his own dreams: it is
an inexpensive and gentlemanly pleasure.
If his bent is that way, he becomes
Big Man Me: Fortunatus's purse jingles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in his pocket; the slave jumps when he
rubs the lamp; he excels in all manly
sports. If you ask with what authority
I can thus postulate the home-made
dreams of any lier in bed but myself,
the answer is easy. It is common knowledge
that the half-awake minds of men
thus employ themselves, and the fashion
of their employment may be reasonably
deduced from observation of
individuals. The <i>ego</i> even of a modest
man will be somewhat rampant; the <i>ego</i>
of a conceited one would, barring its
capability for infinite expansion, swell
up and bust. But this riot of egoism has
as little relation to the Fine Art of Lying
in Bed as a movie play has to the fine
art of the drama. The true artist may
take fair advantage of his nice state of
unreason to defy time and space, but
he will respect essential verities. He
will treat his <i>ego</i> like the child it is; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
taking example from a careful mother,
tie a rope to it when he lets it out to
play. Thus he will capture a kind of
immortality; and his lying in bed, a
transitory state itself, will contradict
the transitory character of life outside
of it. Companions he has known and
loved will come from whatever remote
places to share these moments, for the
Fine Art of Lying in Bed consists largely
in cultivating that inward eye with
which Wordsworth saw the daffodils.</p>

<p>Whether this can be done on the
wooden pillow of the Japanese I have
no way of knowing; but I suspect there
were some admirable liers in bed among
the Roman patricians who were grossly
accused of effeminacy because they
slept on feathers.</p>

<p>The north of China, where bedding
is laid in winter on raised platforms
gently heated by little furnaces underneath,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
must have produced some highly
cultivated liers in bed. The proverbial
shortness of the German bed (which
perhaps explains the German <i>Kultur</i>)
may have tended to discourage the art
and at the same time unconsciously
stimulated a hatred of England, where
the beds are proverbially generous. One
can at least hope, however, that all beds
are alike in this matter, provided the
occupant is a proper lier, who can say
fairly,&mdash;</p>

<h2>TO BORE OR NOT TO BORE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">'Take</span> me away,' said Thomas
Carlyle, when silence settled for
a moment over a dinner-table where
one of the diners had been monologuing
to the extreme limit of boredom, 'for
God's sake take me away and put me
in a room by myself and give me a
pipe of tobacco!'</p>

<p>Little as we may otherwise resemble
Carlyle, many of us have felt this emotion;
and some realize (although the
painful suspicion comes from a mind
too analytical for its own comfort) that
we may have occasioned it. The nice
consideration for the happiness of others
which marks a gentleman may even
make him particularly susceptible to
this haunting apprehension. Carlyle
defined the feeling when he said, 'To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sit still and be pumped into is never an
exhilarating process.' But pumping is
different. How often have I myself, my
adieus seemingly done, my hat in my
hand and my feet on the threshold,
taken a fresh grip, hat or no hat, on the
pump-handle, and set good-natured,
Christian folk distressedly wondering
if I would never stop! And how often
have I afterward recalled something
strained and morbidly intent in their
expressions, a glassiness of the staring
eye and a starchiness in the smiling lip,
that has made me suffer under my bed-cover
and swear that next time I would
depart like a sky-rocket!</p>

<p>Truly it seems surprising, in a fortunate
century when the correspondence
school offers so many inexpensive
educational advantages for deficient
adults, that one never sees an
advertisement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 17em;"><p class="center">STOP BEING A BORE!</p>

<p>Then sign and mail this coupon <i>at once</i>.

famous mail course, <i>How not to be a Bore</i>.</p></div>

<p>The explanation, I fancy, must be
that people who sign and mail coupons
<i>at once</i> do not know when they are
bored; that the word 'boredom,' so
hopelessly heavy with sad significance
to many of us, is nevertheless but caviar
to the general and no bait at all for an
enterprising correspondence school.</p>

never been studied, and the
broad division into Bores Positive and
Bores Negative is so recent that I have
but this minute made it myself.</p>

<p>The Bore Positive pumps; the Bore
Negative compels pumping. Unlike Carlyle,
he regards being pumped into as
an exhilarating process, and so, like the
Old Man of the Sea on Sinbad's tired
shoulders, he sits tight and says nothing;
the difference being that, whereas the
Old Man kept Sinbad walking, the Bore
Negative keeps his victim talking. Charlie
Wax&mdash;who lives down town in the
shop-window and is always so well-dressed&mdash;would
be a fine Bore Negative
if one were left alone with him under
compulsion to keep up a conversation.</p>

<p>Boredom, in fact, is an acquired distaste&mdash;a
by-product of the printing-press
and steam-engine, which between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
them have made and kept mankind
busier than Solomon in all his wisdom
could have imagined. Our arboreal ancestor
could neither bore nor be bored.
We see him&mdash;with the mind's eye&mdash;up
there in his tree, poor stupid, his
think-tank (if the reader will forgive
me a word which he or she may not
have <i>quite</i> accepted) practically empty;
nothing but a few primal, inarticulate
thinks at the bottom. It will be a million
years or so yet before his progeny
will say a long farewell to the old home
in the tree; and even then they will lack
words with which to do the occasion
justice.</p>

<p>Language, in short, must be invented
before anybody can be bored with it.
And I do not believe, although I find it
stated in a ten-volume Science-History
of the Universe, that 'language
is an internal necessity, begotten of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
lustful longing to express, through the
plastic vocal energy, man's secret sense
of his ability to interpret Nature.' An
internal necessity, yes&mdash;except in the
case of the Bore Negative, who prefers
to listen; but quite as likely begotten
of man's anything but secret sense
of his ability to interpret himself.</p>

<p>Speech grew slowly; and mankind,
now a speaking animal, had centuries&mdash;nay,
epochs&mdash;in which to become
habituated to the longwindedness that
Job accepted as a matter of course in
Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. So that
even to-day many, like Job, Eliphaz,
Bildad, and Zophar, bore and are bored
without really knowing it.</p>

<p>In the last analysis a bore bores because
he keeps us from something more
interesting than himself. He becomes
a menace to happiness in proportion as
the span of life is shortened by an increasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
number of things to do and
places to go between crib and coffin.
Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, full of an
unusual personal experience that the
leisurely reader finds most horridly entertaining,
bored the Wedding Guest
because at that moment the Wedding
Guest wanted to get to the wedding,
and was probably restrained from violence
only by the subconscious thought
that it is not good form to appear at
such functions with a missing button.
But the Mariner was too engrossed in
his own tale to notice this lack of interest;
and so invariably is the Bore Positive:
everything escapes him except his
listener.</p>

<p>But no matter how well we know
when we are bored, none of us can be
certain that he does not sometimes
bore&mdash;not even Tammas. The one
certainty is that <i>I may bore</i>, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
on the very occasion when I have felt
myself as entertaining as a three-ring
circus, I may in effect have been as gay
and chatty as a like number of tombstones.
There are persons, for that
matter, who are bored by circuses and
delighted by tombstones. My mistake
may have been to put all my conversational
eggs in one basket&mdash;which, indeed,
is a very good way to bore people.</p>

<p>Dynamo Doit, teaching his class of
industrious correspondents, would probably
write them, with a picture of himself
shaking his fist to emphasize his
point: 'Do not try to exhaust your subject.
You will only exhaust your audience.
Never talk for more than three
minutes on any topic. Wear a wrist-watch
<i>and keep your eye on it</i>. If at the
end of <i>three minutes</i> you cannot change
the subject, tell one of the following
anecdotes.' And I am quite sure also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that Professor Doit would write to his
class: 'Whatever topic you discuss,
<i>discuss it originally</i>. Be apt. Be bright.
Be pertinent. Be <i>yourself</i>. Remember
always that it is not so much what you
say as the <i>way you say it</i> that will charm
your listener. Think clearly. Illustrate
and drive home your meaning with illuminating
figures&mdash;the sort of thing
that your hearer will remember and
pass on to others as "another of So-and-so's
<i>bon-mots</i>." Here you will find that
reading the "Wit and Humor" column
in newspapers and magazines is a great
help. And speak plainly. Remember
that unless you are <i>heard</i> you cannot
expect to <i>interest</i>. On this point, dear
student, I can do no better than repeat
Lord Chesterfield's advice to his son:
"Read what Cicero and Quintilian say
of enunciation."'</p>

<p>But perhaps, after all, enunciation is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
no more important than renunciation;
and the first virtue that we who do not
wish to be bores must practise is abstemiousness
of self. I know it is hard,
but I do not mean total abstinence. A
man who tried to converse without his
<i>I's</i> would make but a blind stagger at
it. This short and handsome word (as
Colonel Roosevelt might have said) is
not to be utterly discarded without
danger of such a silence as would transform
the experimenter into a Bore
Negative of the most negative description.
Practically deprived of speech,
he would become like a Charlie Wax
endowed with locomotion and provided
with letters of introduction. But one
can at least curb the pronoun, and, with
shrewd covert glances at his wrist-watch,
confine the personally conducted
tour into and about Myself within reasonable
limits. Let him say bravely in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the beginning, 'I will not talk about
Myself for more than thirty minutes by
my wrist-watch'; then reduce it to
twenty-five; then to twenty&mdash;and so
on to the irreducible minimum; and he
will be surprised to feel how his popularity
increases with leaps and bounds at
each reduction&mdash;provided, of course,
that he finds anything else to talk about.</p>

<p>Your Complete Bore, however, is incapable
of this treatment, for he does
not know that he is a bore. It is only
the Occasional Bore, a sensitive, well-meaning
fellow who would not harm
anybody, whose head lies sleepless on a
pillow hot with his blushes while he goes
over and over so apt and tripping a dialogue
that it would withhold Gabriel
from blowing his trumpet. So it seems
to him in his bed; but alas, these dialogues
are never of any practical use.
They comfort, but they do not cure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
For no person ever talks to us as we
talk to ourselves. The better way is to
decide firmly (1) to get a wrist-watch,
and (2) to get to sleep.</p>

<p>There is, however, one infallible rule
for not being a bore,&mdash;or at any rate
for not being much of a bore,&mdash;and that
is, never to make a call, or talk to one
person, or to several at once, for more
than fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes
is not really a very long time, although
it may seem so. But to apply this rule
successfully one must become adept in
the Fine Art of Going Away. Resting
your left hand negligently on your
right knee, so that the wrist protrudes
with an effect of careless grace from the
cuff, you have glanced at your watch
and observed that the fifteen minutes
are up. You get up yourself. Others
get up&mdash;or, if there is but one other,
she. So far, so good. But now that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
everybody is up, new subjects of conversation,
as if catching this rising infection,
come up also. You are in a
position in which, except by rather too
oratorical or dramatic a gesture, you
cannot look at your watch; more than
that, if you bore a person sitting down
and wondering when you are going to
get up, you bore far worse a person
standing up and wondering when you
will go away. That you have in effect
started to go away&mdash;and not gone
away&mdash;and yet must go away some
time&mdash;and may go away at any minute:
this consciousness, to a person standing
first on one tired foot and then on
the other, rapidly becomes almost, but
never quite, unendurable. Reason totters,
but remains on the throne. One
can almost lay down a law: <i>Two persons
who do not part with kisses should
part with haste.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The way to do is to go like the sky-rocket&mdash;up
and out.</p>

<p>But the fifteen-minute call followed
by the flying exit is at best only a niggling
and unsatisfactory solution; it is
next door to always staying at home.
Then certainly you would never be a
bore (except to the family); but neither
by any possibility could you ever be
that most desirable factor in life, the
Not-Bore. The Hermit is a slacker.
Better far to come out of your cave,
mingle, bore as little as may be&mdash;and
thank Heaven that here and there you
meet one whom you somehow feel reasonably
certain that you do not bore.</p>

<h2>WHERE TOILS THE TAILOR</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Of</span> the several places in which a
man waits to have something
done to him, no other is so restful as the
establishment of his tailor. His doctor
and his dentist do their best with inviting
chairs and a pile of magazines on the
table: one gets an impression that both
of them were once liberal subscribers to
the current periodicals, but stopped a
year or two ago and have never bought
a magazine since. But these, in their
official capacity, are painful gentlemen;
and a long procession of preceding patients
have imparted to the atmosphere
of their waiting-rooms a heavy sense of
impending misery.</p>

<p>The tailor is different. 'There was
peace,' wrote Meredith, 'in Mr. Goren's
shop. Badgered ministers, bankrupt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
merchants, diplomatists with a headache,&mdash;any
of our modern grandees
under difficulties,&mdash;might have envied
that peace over which Mr. Goren presided:
and he was an enviable man. He
loved his craft, he believed he had not
succeeded the millions of antecedent
tailors in vain.'</p>

<p>And so it is, I dare say, in varying
degree with all tailors; or at any rate
should be, for tailor and customer meet
on the pleasantest imaginable plane of
congenial interest. A person whose chief
desire in life at the moment is to be
becomingly dressed comes to one whose
chief ambition in life at the moment is
to becomingly dress him. No hideous
and insistent apprehension preys on
the mind of the waiting customer; for
the tailor's worst tool is a tape-measure,
and his worst discovery may be that
the customer is growing fat. One waits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
indeed, without serious apprehension,
at the barber's; but here the company
is mixed and the knowledge inescapable
that it will look on with idle interest
while he cuts your hair or covers your
honest face with lather. Only the harmless
necessary assistant will see you
measured, and he, by long practise, has
acquired an air of remoteness and indifference
that makes him next thing to
invisible. So complete indeed is this
tactful abstraction that one might imagine
him a man newly fallen in love.</p>

<p>I have seen it stated, though I cannot
remember just where, that the Old
Testament makes no mention of the
tailor; the Book, however, shows plainly
that Solomon was not only a sage but
also a best-dresser, and it stands to
reason that his wives did not make his
clothes. One wife might have done it,
but not three hundred. A tailor came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
at intervals to the palace, and then
went back to where, somewhere in the
business section of the ancient city,
there was doubtless a tablet with a
cuneiform inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/002.png" width="195" height="102" alt="I am he that makes the
Glory of Solomon: yea,
and Maker of the Upper
and the Nether Glory." title="" />
</div>



<p>The Smart Set of Solomon's day patronized
him, yet he remained, quite naturally,
beneath the notice of the Old Testament
writers&mdash;unfashionable men,
one may readily believe, living at a
convenient period when a garment very
much like our own bath-robe answered
their own purposes, and could probably
be bought ready-to-wear.</p>

<p>But one can no more think of a full-blown
civilization without tailors than
one can imagine a complex state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
society in which, for example, the contemporary
<i>Saturday Evening Post</i> would
publish its Exclusive Saturday Evening
Styles, and gentlemen would habitually
buy their patterns by bust-measure and
cut out their new suits at home on the
dining-room table. The idea may seem
practical, but the bust with men is
evidently not a reliable guide to all the
other anatomical proportions. Nor,
again, however little the Old Testament
concerns itself with tailors, did it fail to
mention the first of them. The line
goes back to Adam, cross-legged under
the Tree&mdash;the first tailor and the
first customer together&mdash;companioned,
pleasantly enough, by the first 'little
dressmaker.' They made their clothes
together, and made them alike&mdash;an
impressive, beautiful symbol of the perfect
harmony between the sexes that the
world lost and is now slowly regaining.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Times have changed since Adam: the
apron of his honest anxious handicraft&mdash;for
it was the penalty of his sin that
he would never be happy until he got it
finished and put it on&mdash;has undergone
many changes, in the course of which
even its evolution into Plymouth Rock
Pants, yes even those once seemingly
eternal lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the pant-hunter pantless<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is panting for pants,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>are now fading from human memory;
yet until within the past few decades a
gentleman had a tailor as inexorably as
he had a nose. But now the immemorial
visit to his tailor is no longer absolutely
necessary. He may, if such is his
inclination,&mdash;as I am sure it would
have been Adam's,&mdash;get his new suit
all finished and ready-to-wear. Charley
Wax, the sartorially Perfect Gentleman,
smiles invitation and encouragement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from many a window; an army of elegant
and expeditious employees, each
as much like Charley Wax as is humanly
possible, waits to conduct him to a million
ready-to-wear suits. His intellect
is appealed to by the plausible argument
that we live in a <i>busy time</i>, in which the
<i>leaders of men</i> simply cannot <i>afford to
waste</i> their valuable hours by going to
the tailor: at the ready-to-wear emporium
you simply pay your money and
take your choice.</p>

<p>Many a gentleman, suddenly discovering
that he is a 'leader of men,' has
deserted his tailor: many a gentleman,
learning by experience that it takes as
long to try on clothes in one place as
another, has presently gone back to
him. Starting with the democratic
premise that all men are born equal,
the ready-to-wear clothier proceeds on
the further assumption that each man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
becomes in time either short, stout, or
medium; and this amendment to the
Declaration of Independence has indeed
created a new republic of shorts,
stouts, and mediums, in which Charley
Wax is the perpetual president. Here,
indeed, would seem to be a step toward
patterns for gentlemen: one sees the
gentleman in imagination happily cutting
out his new spring suit on the dining-room
table, or sitting cross-legged
on that centre of domestic hospitality,
while he hums a little tune to himself
and merrily sews the sections together.</p>

<p>But unfortunately the shorts, stouts,
and mediums are not respectively standard
according to bust-measure. A gentleman,
for example, may simultaneously
be short in the legs, medium in
the chest, and stout in the circumference:
the secret of the ready-to-wear
clothier lies in his ability to meet on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
spot conditions which no single pattern
could hope to anticipate. We must go
back toward nature, and stop short at
Adam, to find a costume that any
gentleman can successfully make for
himself.</p>

<p>Personally I prefer the immemorial
visit to the tailor; I like this restful atmosphere,
in which unborn suits of
clothes contentedly await creation in
rolls of cloth, and the styles of the
season are exhibited by pictures of
gentlemen whose completely vacuous
countenances comfortably repudiate the
desirability of being 'leaders of men.'
On the table the <i>Geographical Magazine</i>
invites to unexciting wonder at the way
other people dress. From the next room
one hears the voice of the tailor, leisurely
reporting to his assistant as he tape-measures
a customer. In the lineage of
a vocation it is odd to think that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
great-great-great grandfather might
have sat cross-legged to inspire the poem</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A carrion crow sat on an oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching a tailor shape a coat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Wife, bring me my old bent bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may shoot yon carrion crow.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tailor shot, and he missed the mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shot the miller's sow through the heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Wife, O, wife, bring brandy in a spoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old miller's sow is in a swoon.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The quick and unexpected tragedy (for
the sow) etches the old-time tailor at
his work: one gets, as it were, a crow's-eye
view of him. Such, I imagine, was
his universal aspect, cross-legged on a
bench in his little stall or beside his
open window, more skilled with shears
and needle than with lethal weapon,
despite the gallant brigade of tailors
who went to battle under the banner of
Queen Elizabeth. Yet I cannot imagine
my own tailor sitting cross-legged beside
an open window; nor, for that matter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sitting cross-legged anywhere, except
perhaps on the sands of the sea in his
proper bathing-suit. His genealogy begins
with those 'taylours' who, in the
nineteenth year of Henry VII, 'sewyd
the Kynge to be callyd Marchante Taylours'&mdash;evidently
earning the disfavor
of their neighbors, for a 'grete grudge
rose among dyuers other craftys in the
cyte against them.' Very soon, I fancy,
these Marchante Taylours began to
pride themselves on the straightness of
their legs, and let subordinate craftsmen
stretch their sartorius muscles.
But why, as Carlyle puts it, the idea
had 'gone abroad, and fixed itself
down in a wide-spreading rooted error,
that Tailors are a distinct species in
Physiology, not Men, but fractional
Parts of a Man,' nobody has yet explained
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>So one muses, comfortably awaiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the tailor, while the eye travels through
far countries, glimpsing now and then
a graceful figure that somehow reminds
one of a darker complexioned September
Morn, and helps perhaps to explain
the wide-spread popularity of a magazine
whose title seems at first thought
to limit it to a public-school circulation.</p>

<p>And yet, strangely enough, there are
men whose wives find it difficult to persuade
them to go to the tailor; or, for
that matter to the ready-to-wear clothier.
There is, after all, something undignified
in standing on a little stool and
being measured; nor is it a satisfactory
substitute for this procedure to put on
strange garments in a little closet and
come forth to pose before mirrors under
the critical eye of a living Charley Wax.
Fortunately the tailor and the polite and
expeditious salesman of the ready-to-wear
emporium have this in common:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
art or nature has in both cases produced
a man seemingly with no sense of humor.
Fortunately, too, in both cases a gentleman
goes alone to acquire a new suit.
I have seen it suggested in the advertising
column of the magazine that a
young man should bring his fianc&eacute;e
with him, to help select his ready-to-wear
garments; but the idea emanates from
the imagination of an ad-writer, and I
am sure that nobody concerned, except
perhaps the fianc&eacute;e, would welcome it
in actual practice. Wives indeed, and
maybe fianc&eacute;es, sometimes accompany
those they love when a hat is to be tried
on and purchased; but I have been told
in bitter confidence by a polite hatter
that 'tis a custom more honored in the
breach than in the observance; and this
I think is sufficient reason why it should
not be extended, so to speak, to the
breeches.</p>

<h2>SHAVING THOUGHTS</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">'Talking</span> of shaving the other
night at Dr. Taylor's,' wrote the
biographer Boswell, 'Dr. Johnson said,
"Sir, of a thousand shavers, two do not
shave so much alike as not to be distinguished."
I thought this not possible,
till he specified so many of the varieties
in shaving,&mdash;holding the razor more or
less perpendicular; drawing long or short
strokes; beginning at the upper part of
the face, or the under; at the right side
or the left side. Indeed, when one considers
what variety of sounds can be uttered
by the windpipe, in the compass
of a very small aperture, we may be
convinced how many degrees of difference
there may be in the application of
the razor.'</p>

<p>So they talked of shaving at Dr. Taylor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
before the advent of the safety-razor;
and our curiosity can never be
satisfied as to just what so acute an
observer as Dr. Johnson would have
thought of this characteristically modern
invention to combine speed and
convenience. I can imagine Boswell
playfully reminding the doctor how
that illustrious friend had quite recently
expressed his disapproval of bleeding.
'Sir,' says Samuel, as he actually
did on another occasion, 'courage is a
quality necessary for maintaining virtue.'
And he adds (blowing with high
derision), 'Poh! If a man is to be intimidated
by the possible contemplation
of his own blood&mdash;let him grow
whiskers.' At any rate among a thousand
shavers to-day, two do not think
so much alike that one may not be influenced
by this consideration, and regard
Byron, composing his verses while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
shaving, as a braver poet than if he had
performed the operation with a safety.</p>

<p>The world of shavers is divided into
three classes: the ordinary shaver,
the safety shaver, and the extraordinary-safety
shaver, who buys each safety
razor as soon as it is invented and
is never so happy as when about to try
a new one. To a shaver of this class,
cost is immaterial. A safety-razor for
a cent, with twenty gold-monogramed
blades and a guaranty of expert surgical
attendance if he cuts himself, would
stir his active interest neither more nor
less than a safety-razor for a hundred
dollars, with one Cannotbedull blade
and an iron-clad agreement to pay the
makers an indemnity if he found it unsatisfactory.
He buys them secretly,
lest his wife justly accuse him of extravagance,
and practises cunning in getting
rid of them afterward; for to a conscientious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
gentleman throwing away a
razor is a responsible matter. It is hard
to think of any place where a razor-blade,
indestructible and horribly sharp
as it is,&mdash;for all purposes except shaving,&mdash;can
be thrown away without
some worry over possible consequences.
A baby may find and swallow it; the
ashman sever an artery; dropping it
overboard at sea is impracticable, to say
nothing of the danger to some innocent
fish. Mailing it anonymously to the
makers, although it is expensive, is a
solution, or at least shifts the responsibility.
Perhaps the safest course is
to put the blades with the odds and
ends you have been going to throw
away to-morrow ever since you can
remember; for there, while you live,
nobody will ever disturb them. Once,
indeed, I&mdash;but this is getting too personal:
I was simply about to say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
it is possible to purchase a twenty-five
cent safety-razor, returnable if unsatisfactory,
and find the place of sale
vanished before you can get back to
it. But between inventions in safety-razors,
the extraordinary-safety shaver
is likely to revert to first principles and
the naked steel of his ancestors.</p>

<p>And as he shaves he will perhaps
think sometimes of the unhappy Edward
II of England, who, before his
fall, wore his beard in three corkscrew
curls&mdash;and was shaved afterward by
a cruel jailer who had it done <i>with cold
water</i>! The fallen monarch wept with
discomfort and indignation. 'Here at
least,' he exclaimed reproachfully, 'is
warm water on my cheeks, whether you
will or no.' But the heartless shave
proceeded. Razed away were those
corkscrew curls from the royal chin,
and so he comes down to us without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
them, shaved as well as bathed in tears&mdash;one
of the most pitiful figures in
history.</p>

<p>Personally, however, I prefer to think
of kindlier scenes while shaving. Nothing
that I can do now can help poor
Edward: no indignation of mine can
warm that cold water; perhaps, after
all, the cruel jailer had a natural and
excusable hatred of corkscrew curls anywhere.
I should feel quite differently
about it if he had warmed the water;
but although a man may shave himself
with cold water, certainly nobody else
has a right to.</p>

<p>There have been periods in the history
of man when I, too, would probably
have cultivated some form of
whiskering. Perhaps, like Mr. Richard
Shute, I would have kept a gentleman
(reduced) to read aloud to me while my
valet starched and curled my whiskers&mdash;such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
being the mode in the seventeenth
century when Mr. Shute was
what they then called, without meaning
offense, a turkey merchant; and indeed
his pride in his whiskers was nothing out
of the common. Or, being less able to
support a valet to starch and curl, and
a gentleman to read aloud 'on some
useful subject,'&mdash;poor gentleman! I
hope that he and Mr. Shute agreed as
to what subjects were useful, but I
have a feeling they didn't,&mdash;I might
have had to economize, and might
have been one of those who were 'so
curious in the management of their
beards that they had pasteboard cases
to put over them at night, lest they
turn upon them and rumple them in
their sleep.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless, wives continued to respect
their husbands in about the normal
proportion. Within the relatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
brief compass of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, I, who would have gone
smooth-shaven in the fourteenth, could
conceivably have fluttered in at least
thirty-eight separate and beautiful arrangements
of moustaches, beard, and
whiskers. Nor, I suspect, did these arrangements
always wait upon the slow
processes of nature. One does not <i>have</i>
to grow whiskers. Napoleon's youthful
officers were fiercely bewhiskered, but
often with the aid of helpfully adhesive
gum; and in the eighteen-thirties
there occurs in the Boston <i>Transcript</i>,
as a matter of course, an advertisement
of 'gentlemen's whiskers ready-made
or to order.' We see in imagination a
quiet corner at the whisker's, with a
mirror before which the Bostonian tries
on his ready-made whiskers before ordering
them sent home; or again, the
Bostonian in doubt, selecting now this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
whisker, now that from the <i>Gentlemen's
Own Whisker Book</i>, and still with a shade
of indecision on his handsome face as
he holds it up to be measured. 'Perhaps,
after all, those <i>other</i> whiskers&mdash;'</p>

<p>But the brisk, courteous person with
the dividers and tape-measure is reassuring.
'Elegant whiskers!' he repeats
at intervals. 'They will do us both
credit.'</p>

<p>The matter has, in fact, been intelligently
studied; the beautifying effect of
whiskers reduced to principles. If my
face is too wide, a beard lengthens it;
if my face is too narrow, it expands as
if by magic with the addition of what
have sometimes been affectionately
called 'mutton chops,' or 'siders'; if my
nose projects, almost like a nose trying
to escape from a face to which it has
been sentenced for life, a pair of large,
handsome moustaches will provide a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
proper entourage&mdash;a nest, so to speak,
on which the nose rests contentedly,
almost like a setting hen; if my nose
retreats backward into my face, the
&aelig;sthetic solution is obviously galways.
A stout gentleman can do wonders with
his appearance by adopting a pointed
beard, and a suit of clothes, shirt,
necktie, and stockings with pronounced
vertical stripes. A thin one, on the
other hand, becomes at once substantial
in effect, without being gross, if
he cultivates side-whiskers, and wears
a suit of clothes, shirt, cravat, and
stockings with pronounced horizontal
stripes. If my face lacks fierceness
and dynamic force, it needs a brisk,
arrogant moustache; or if it has too
much of these qualities, a long, sad,
drooping moustache will counterbalance
them. I read in my volume of
<i>Romantic Love and Personal Beauty</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that 'the movements of the moustache
are dependent on the muscle called <i>depressor
al&aelig; nasi</i>. By specially cultivating
this muscle, men might in course of
time make the movements of the moustache
subject to voluntary control.'</p>

<p>Just think what a capacity for emotional
expression lies in such a simple
organ as the dog's caudal appendage,
aptly called the 'psychographic tail' by
Vischer; and moustaches are double,
and therefore equal to two psychographic
appendages! Truly I know
not of which to think first&mdash;a happy
gentleman wagging his moustache or a
happy dog wagging two tails. And yet
here am I, shaving away the daily effort
of this double psychographic appendage
to become visible! One might almost
think that my <i>depressor al&aelig; nasi</i> was a
vermiform appendix.</p>

<p>It has been said by some critics that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
whiskers are a disguise. I should be unwilling
to commit myself to this belief;
nor can I accept the contrary conviction
that whiskers are a gift of Almighty
Providence in which the Giver is so sensitively
interested that to shave them
off is to invite eternal punishment of
a kind&mdash;and this, I think, destroys the
theory&mdash;that would singe them off in
about two seconds. Whiskers are real,
and sometimes uncomfortably earnest;
the belief that they betoken an almost
brutal masculine force is visible in this,
that those whose whiskers are naturally
thinnest take the greatest satisfaction
in possessing them&mdash;seem, in fact, to
say proudly, '<i>These</i> are my whiskers!'
But I cannot feel that a gentleman is
any more disguised by his whiskers,
real, ready-made, or made to order,
than he would be if he appeared naked
or in a ready-made or made-to-order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
suit. Whiskers, in fact, are a subtle revelation
of real character, whether the
kind that exist as a soft, mysterious
haze about the lower features or such
as inspired the immortal limerick,&mdash;I
quote from memory,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was an old man with a beard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who said, 'I am greatly afeard<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two larks and a hen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A jay and a wren,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have each made a nest in my beard.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet I feel also, and strongly, that the
man who shaves clean stands, as it
were, on his own face.</p>

<p>We have, indeed, but to visualize
clearly the spectacle of a gentleman
shaving himself and put beside it the
spectacle of a gentleman starching and
curling his whiskers, to see the finer
personal dignity that has come with the
general adoption of the razor. I am not
going to attempt to describe a gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
starching and curling his whiskers,&mdash;it
would be too horrible,&mdash;but I like
to dwell on the shaver. He whistles or
perhaps hums. He draws hot water
from the faucet&mdash;Alas, poor Edward!
He makes a rich, creamy lather either
in a mug or (for the sake of literary
directness) on his own with a shaving-stick.
He strops his razor, or perhaps
selects a blade already sharpened for
his convenience. He rubs in the lather.
He shaves, and, as Dr. Johnson so
shrewdly pointed out that night at Dr.
Taylor's, 'Sir, of a thousand shavers,
two do not shave so much alike as not
to be distinguished.' Perhaps he cuts
himself, for a clever man at self-mutilation
can do it, even with a safety;
but who cares? Come, Little Alum, the
shaver's friend, smartly to the rescue!
And then, he exercises the shaver's
prerogative and powders his face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately the process does not always
go so smoothly. There are times
when the Local Brotherhood of Razors
have gone on strike and refuse to be
stropped. There are times at which the
twelve interchangeable blades are hardly
better for shaving than twelve interchangeable
postage-stamps. There are
times when the lather might have been
fairly guaranteed to dry on the face.
There are times when Little Alum, the
shaver's friend, might well feel the
sting of his own powerlessness. But
these times are the blessed cause of
genial satisfaction when everything
goes happily.</p>

<p>Truly it is worth while to grow a
beard&mdash;for the sake of shaving it off.
Not such a beard as one might starch
and curl&mdash;but the beginnings&mdash;an obfuscation
of the chin, cheeks, and upper
lip&mdash;a horror of unseemly growth&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
landscape of the face comparable to</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">that ominous tract which, all agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hides the Dark Tower<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>in Browning's grim poem of 'Childe
Roland.' <i>Then</i> is the time to strop
your favorite razor! I wonder, while
stropping mine, if any man still lives
who uses a moustache cup?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<h2>OH, THE AFTERNOON TEA!</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Any</span> man who knows that, sooner
or later, he must go to another
afternoon tea cannot but rejoice at the
recent invention of an oval, platter-like
saucer, large enough to hold with ease a
cup, a lettuce or other sandwich, and a
dainty trifle of pastry. The thing was
needed: the modesty of the anonymous
inventor&mdash;evidently <i>not</i> Mr. Edison&mdash;reveals
him one of the large body
of occasional and unwilling tea-goers.
We, the reluctant and unwilling, are all
strangely alike at these functions; and
we have all been embarrassed by the
old-fashioned saucer. Circular in shape,
and hardly larger than the cup that belies
its reputation and dances drunkenly
whenever another guest joggles our
elbow,&mdash;which happens so often that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
we suspect conspiracy,&mdash;the old-fashioned
saucer affords no reasonably secure
perch for a sandwich; responds
with delight to the law of gravitation
if left to itself; and sets us wishing,
those of us who think scientifically,
that evolution had refrained from doing
away with an extension by which
alone we could now hope to manage it.
<i>We mean a tail!</i> If afternoon teas had
been started in the Oligocene Epoch
instead of the seventeenth century, we
are convinced that evolution, far from
discarding this useful appendage, would
have perfected it. A little hand would
have evolved at the end of it&mdash;such
a one as might hold a Perfect Gentleman's
saucer while he sipped from his
tea-cup.</p>

<p>Nay, more. In many ways that will
at once occur to the intelligent reader
this little hand would be helpful in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
complex modern civilization. It would
hold this essay. It would turn the
music at the piano. It would enable
two well-disposed persons cordially to
shake hands when their four other
hands were busy with bundles. It
would slap the coward mosquito that
stabs in the back. It would be absolutely
perfect for waving farewell. Nor
would there be anything 'funny' about
it, or shocking to the most refined sensibilities:
the vulgar would laugh and the
refined would hide a shudder at the
sight of a man with no tail! We would,
of course, all look like the Devil, but
everybody knows that <i>his</i> tail has never
yet kept him out of polite society.</p>

<p>This digression, however, leads us
away from our subject into alien regrets.
We put it behind us.</p>

<p>The truth is, we do not like your
afternoon teas&mdash;except those little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
ones, like the nice children of an objectionable
mother, that are informal,
intimate, and not destructive of our
identity. At larger gatherings we have
no identity: we are supernumeraries,
mere tea-cup bearers, wooden Indians
who have been through Hampton, hand-carved
gentlemen, automaton tea-goers.
In short, we are so many lay figures,
each with a tea-cup in one hand and
food in the other; we know that we are
smiling because we can feel it; we remain
where we are laid until forcibly moved to
another spot, and we are capable, under
pressure, of emitting a few set phrases
that resemble human speech.</p>

<p>Yet within this odd simulacrum of a
worldly, entertaining, and interested
gentleman, a living mind surveys the
gay scene with a strange, emotionless
detachment&mdash;just so, perhaps, will it
eventually survive the body. We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
really alive, conscious that we dislike
change, nervous when moved and stood
up in another place, and intellectually
certain that no real harm can come to us.
One is reminded of Seneca's observation:
<i>Vere magnum, habere fragilitatem hominis,
securitatem dei.</i> There is about
us something of the frailty of a man,
something of the security of a god; the
pity of it is that we cannot follow Seneca
to his conclusion and comfort ourselves
with the thought that we are
'truly great.'</p>

<p>I have often wondered, while 'dolling
up,' as the strikingly appropriate
modernism puts it, for such a function,
whether there is any universal reason
why a reluctant man should go to an
afternoon tea. There are, of course,
many individual reasons, more or less
important to the individual tea-goer;
but for us the impulsion comes inevitably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from without. The verb 'drag,'
often applied to the process by which
a man is brought to a tea, indicates how
valuable would be the discovery of a
Universal Reason wherefore any man
might hope to derive some personal
good from this inescapable experience.</p>

<p>An excellent place for the thinker to
examine this problem is in his bath-tub
preparatory to dolling up. He is alone
and safe from interruption, unless he
has forgotten to lock the door; his memory
and observation of afternoon teas
past is stimulated by afternoon tea to
come; and he is himself more like the
Universal Man than on most other
occasions. Featherless biped mammals
that we are, what need have we in
common that might conceivably provide
a good and sufficient reason for
the dolling up to which I am about
to subject myself? Substantial food,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
less fleeting, however, than a lettuce or
other sandwich and a dainty trifle of
pastry; protective clothing; a house,
or even a cave, to shelter us in cold
or stormy weather&mdash;these, evidently,
are clearly apprehended necessities, and
we will march on the soles of our feet,
like the plantigrade creatures we are,
wherever such goods are obtainable.</p>

<p>If all men were hungry, naked, and
homeless, and the afternoon tea provided
food, clothes, and a home, any
man would jump at an invitation. But
there are other necessities of living&mdash;and
here, too, I in my porcelain dish
am one with Christopher Columbus,
Lord Chesterfield, Chang the Chinese
Giant, the Editor of the <i>Atlantic</i>, and the
humblest illiterate who never heard of
him&mdash;of which we are not so vividly
conscious. Yet we seek them instinctively,
each in his own manner and degree&mdash;amusement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
useful experience,
friends, and his own soul. So I read and
accept Tagore when he says, 'Man's
history is the history of man's journey
to the unknown in quest of his immortal
self&mdash;his soul.' Willy-nilly, even higglety-pigglety
and helter-skelter, these
are what the featherless biped is after.</p>

<p>As for useful experience, this afternoon
tea reminds me of those lower
social gatherings where liquor is, or used
to be, sold only to be drunk on the premises.
Granting that I become a finished
tea-goer, easy of speech, nodding, laughing,
secure in the graceful manipulation
of my tea-things, never upsetting
my tea, never putting my sandwich in
the way of an articulating tongue, yet
is all this experience of no use whatever
to me except at other afternoon teas. I
go to school simply to learn how to go
to school. The most finished and complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
tea-goer, if he behaves anywhere
else as he does at an afternoon tea,
creates more widely the same unfavorable
impression that he creates, in his
own proper sphere, on me. Can I then
reasonably regard experience as useful
which I observe to be useful only for
doing something which I observe to be
useless? The soap agrees that I cannot.
Yet, says the sponge, <i>if</i> I might hope
at some afternoon tea to discover my
immortal soul, the case would be different;
this experience would be valuable.
O foolish sponge! I am compelled to
tell you that at afternoon teas it is especially
difficult for a mortal gentleman
to believe that he has any immortal soul
to look for. It is a gathering essentially
mundane and ephemeral. For it we put
on our most worldly garments. For it
we practise our most worldly smirks in
dumb rehearsal before our mirror and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
an audience of one silly, attentive image,
thinking that this time, this time&mdash;But
it is always the same: the observant
mind in the immovable body.
As for the immortal soul, O sponge! it
may, and doubtless does, go to strange
places&mdash;but it <i>cannot be dragged</i>.</p>

<p>And so we come to the final question:
is the afternoon tea a place where one
featherless, plantigrade, biped mammal
of the genus <i>Homo</i> may meet another
whom he might hope some time to call
a friend? I do not mean 'my friend
What's-his-name?' but rather such another
biped as Tennyson had in mind
when he wrote,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Since we deserved the name of friends<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thine effect so lives in me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A part of mine may live in thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And move thee on to noble ends.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I grant you, peering out of my tub at
the world, that there are many to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
this thought sounds sublimated and extravagant:
a poet says this sort of thing
because such is his poetic business. We
come nearer perhaps to the universal
understanding in John Hay's definition
that 'Friends are the sunshine of life';
for it is equally true that all men seek
sunlight and that every man seeks a
friend after his own kind and nature.
The best and most intelligent of us admit
the rarity and value of friendship;
the worst and most ignorant of us are
unwittingly the better for knowing some
friendly companion. But these afternoon
teas are inimical to friendship;
and the first duty of a hostess is to separate,
expeditiously and without hope
of again coming together, any other two
guests who appear to be getting acquainted.
On this count, even were
we not Automaton Tea-Goers, debarred
by inherent stability from any normal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
human intercourse, the afternoon tea
must prove more disheartening than
helpful. We might at best glimpse a
potential friend as the desert islander
sights a passing sail on the far horizon.</p>

<p>There is, alas, no Universal Reason
why a man should go to an afternoon tea!</p>

<p>So the matter looks to me in my tub,
but perhaps, like Diogenes, I am a cynic
philosopher. After all, when a thing
cannot be escaped, why seek for reasons
not to escape it? Let us, rather, be
brave if we cannot be gay; cheerful if
we cannot talk; ornamental if we cannot
move. As the grave-digger in Elsinore
churchyard might say: 'Here lies the
afternoon tea; good: here stands the
gentleman; good: If the gentleman go
to this afternoon tea and bore himself,
it is, will he, nill he, he goes,&mdash;mark
you that? But if the afternoon tea come
to him and bore him, he bores not himself;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
argal, he that goes not willingly to
the afternoon tea wearies not his own
life.'</p>

<p>So, in effect, he that is <i>dragged</i> to an
afternoon tea does not go at all; and
when he gets there, he is really somewhere
else. This happy thought is a
little difficult to reconcile with circumstances;
but when one has become
thoroughly soaked in it, it is a great
help.</p>
